# file2Chat
This is an experimental chat bot which can be used to upload a file and ask questions about it. It uses the llama2 model from gpt4all.

Other libraries used are:
- langchain
- streamlit
- streamlit-chat
- pypdf
- gpt4all
- ChromaDb

The application can be started with `streamlit run main.py `

  It was inspired by this blogpost: https://medium.com/@anoopjohny2000/building-a-conversational-chat-interface-with-streamlit-and-langchain-for-csvs-8c150b1f982d
